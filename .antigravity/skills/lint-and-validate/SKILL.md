# Lint and Validate Skill

> **MANDATORY:** Run appropriate validation tools after EVERY code change. Do not finish a task until the code is error-free.

### Procedures by Ecosystem

#### C# / .NET (this repository's services)
1. **Build:** the affected project only — `dotnet build <project>.csproj -c Debug` (AGENTS.md §5).
2. **Tests:** the tests of that service or project — `dotnet test <service or test project>` (AGENTS.md §5).

#### JavaScript in `frontend/Diten.Web`
1. **Tests:** `npm test`, with `frontend/Diten.Web` as the working directory (vitest). Its `package.json` defines no `lint` script and the repository has no `tsconfig.json`.

#### Node.js / TypeScript
1. **Lint/Fix:** `npm run lint` or `npx eslint "path" --fix`
2. **Types:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
3. **Security:** `npm audit --audit-level=high`

#### Python
1. **Linter (Ruff):** `ruff check "path" --fix` (Fast & Modern)
2. **Security (Bandit):** `bandit -r "path" -ll`
3. **Types (MyPy):** `mypy "path"`

## The Quality Loop
1. **Write/Edit Code**
2. **Run Audit:** the checks of the stack you changed (above). A command the project does not define is neither run nor invented — the report says it was not available.
3. **Analyze Report:** Check the "FINAL AUDIT REPORT" section.
4. **Fix & Repeat:** Submitting code with "FINAL AUDIT" failures is NOT allowed.

## Error Handling
- If `lint` fails: Fix the style or syntax issues immediately.
- If `tsc` fails: Correct type mismatches before proceeding.
- If no tool is configured: say so in the report; do not install a toolchain or add a tool configuration inside the task.

---
**Strict Rule:** No code should be committed or reported as "done" without passing these checks.
