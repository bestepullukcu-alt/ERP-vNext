/*
 * DitenDateField — the ONE date input, and the ONE reason its leading icon is not a picture.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This behaviour lived in assets/js/Tasks/form.js and NOWHERE else, which is exactly why the pattern stopped at
 * one module: a screen that copied the golden reference's MARKUP got the icon and none of the wiring, and
 * shipped a glyph that opens nothing. The markup contract (.diten-field + .diten-field-icon) is shared, so the
 * behaviour that contract implies has to be shared too — otherwise every new form re-decides it, and half of
 * them decide wrong by omission.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT GUARANTEES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. flatpickr, not <input type="date">. A native date input takes its display format from the OPERATING
 *    SYSTEM's locale, so an Arabic page still rendered gg.aa.yyyy — the page's own language never entered into
 *    it. flatpickr draws the calendar itself, and `dateFormat: 'Y-m-d'` keeps the value the input carries
 *    EXACTLY what the native control produced, so nothing the API receives changes.
 * 2. THE LEADING ICON IS A CONTROL, NOT A PICTURE. It sits ON TOP of the field's inline start, so a user aiming
 *    at "the calendar" hits the glyph and not the input. Left unbound that is a dead icon — the same defect as
 *    a dead button, which this project shipped once and had reported as breakage. `allowInput: true` means the
 *    input itself does not open on focus either, so without this the icon would be the one obvious affordance
 *    that does nothing.
 *
 * Returns the number of inputs it enhanced, so a caller can assert it found what it expected.

             * wrapper's child while the control may not be. Walking up to the nearest .diten-field finds it in
             * both shapes; a plain parentElement lookup only worked while the markup stayed flat.
